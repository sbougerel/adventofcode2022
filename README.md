# Rusty AdventOfCode 2022

I'm using [AdventOfCode 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) to learn Rust.
Some projects will also have a Python version cause I like to prototype with it.


This is scantly documented and tested because that's not the objective.

## Usage

For most Rust projects, just:

``` bash
cargo run --bin day[00] [some args] < ../example.txt
```

For most Python projects, just:

``` bash
python day[00].py [some args] < ../example.txt
```

## Improvements

I discovered too late [this template](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust) which looks amazing!

I should have used better crates, like the ones curated in [blessed.rs](https://blessed.rs/crates).
