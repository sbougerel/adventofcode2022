# Rusty AdventOfCode 2022

I'm using [AdventOfCode 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) to learn Rust.
Some projects will also have a Python version cause I like to prototype with it.

This is scantly documented and tested because that's not the objective.

## Usage

For Python, in most projects, just:

``` bash
python code.py some args < some_input.txt
```

Similarly, for Rust:

``` bash
cargo run --bin code < some_input.txt
```
